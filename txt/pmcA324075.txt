Structural organization of a 17 KB segment of the alpha 2 collagen gene: evaluation by R loop mapping.
Abstract
A recombinant phage, SpC3, containing a 17 kb genomic DNA insert representing approximately 60% of the 3' portion of the sheep collagen alpha 2 gene, was evaluated by electron microscopic R loop analysis. A minimum of 17 intervening sequences (introns) and 18 alpha 2 coding sequences (exons) were mapped. With the exception of the 850 base pair exon located at the extreme 3' end of the insert, all exons contained 250 base pairs or less. The total length of all the exons in SpC3 was 3,014 base pairs. The length distribution of the 17 introns ranged from 300 to 1600 base pairs; together, all of the introns comprised 14,070 base pairs of SpC3 DNA. Thus, the DNA region required for coding the interspersed 3 kb of alpha 2 collagen genetic information was 5.6 fold longer than the corresponding alpha 2 mRNA coding sequences.Images

 ABSTRACT 

 A recombinant phage, SpC3, containing a 17 kb genomic DNA insert rep

 resenting approximately 60% of the 3' portion of the sheep collagen a2 gene, was evaluated by electron microscopic R loop analysis. A minimum of 17 intervening sequences (introns) and 18 a2 coding sequences (exons) were 

 mapped. With the exception of the 850 base pair exon located at the extreme 3' end of the insert, all exons contained 250 base pairs or less. The total length of all the exons in SpC3 was 3,014 base pairs. The length distribution of the 17 introns ranged from 300 to 1600 base pairs; together, all of the introns comprised 14,070 base pairs of SpC3 DNA. Thus, the DNA region 

 required for coding the interspersed 3 kb of a2 collagen genetic information was 5.6 fold longer than the corresponding a2 mRNA coding sequences. 

 INTRODUCTION 

 Type I collagen, composed of two al(I) and one a2 polypeptide chains, is the most abundant of the five known mammalian collagen types. It is a major extracellular constituent of tissues such as bone, tendon, skin and lung where, because of its great tensile strength, it plays an important 

 role in tissue structure and function. The polypeptides comprising type I 

 collagen are synthesized in long, precursor forms, referred to as pro al(I) and pro a2 chains,1 each containing approximately 1500 amino acid residues (1). 

 1 The terminology for the primary translation products of the various 

 collagen messenger RNAs is still in a state of flux. It is known that al(I) and a2 chains are synthesized in precursor forms; these are currently termed pro al(I) and pro a2 chains (1). However, recent studies (43,44) have shown that the actual primary translation product of al(I) mRNA is somewhat larger 

 than the pro al(I) chain; this translation product has been termed a "pre-pro al(I) chain." Although the corresponding "pre-pro a2 chain" likely exists, it has not yet been characterized. For simplicity, therefore, until the 

 proper terminology for the primary translation product is clarified, we have 

 chosen to use the terms "al(I)" and "a2" to refer to the type I collagen mRNAs and collagen structural gene sequences.

 There is increasing evidence that the quantities of al(I) and a2 

 chains produced by cells may be regulated, in part, at the genomic level 

 (1). However, to understand the processes which mediate their expression, 

 it is necessary to understand the structural organization of these collagen genes and the various enzymes that modify the collagen chains after its 

 synthesis (1). As an initial approach to this problem, we have recently 

 isolated a recombinant bacteriophage, termed SpC3, containing approximately 60% of the a2 gene for type I collagen. Partial characterization of this 

 a2 gene demonstrated that, like most other structurally evaluated eukaryotic genes, the coding sequences are interspersed with intervening sequences (2). The present study further characterizes this portion of the a2 

 gene by utilizing electron microscopic R loop analysis to map the coding regions (exons) and intervening sequences (introns) contained within the sheep genomic insert of SpC3. The data suggests that the structural 

 organization of this portion of the a2 collagen gene represents 3 kb of coding information that is interspersed in a complex fashion with 17 introns over 17 kb of genome. 

 MATERIALS AND METHODS 

 Isolation and characterization of a2 collagen recombinant clone, SpC3. 

 The sheep a2 collagen recombinant clone, SpC3, containing a portion of the sheep a2 gene, was isolated as previously described (2). Briefly, 

 high molecular weight fetal sheep liver DNA was extracted by the method of Blin and Stafford (3), and 15-20 kb DNA fragments, resulting from partial Eco RI digestion, were isolated and ligated to the left and right arms of Charon 4A. The recombinant DNA was then packaged in vitro and the sheep 

 genomic library amplified (4-6). Screening of the sheep genomic library was 

 conducted utilizing [32 P]-labeled fetal sheep tendon type I collagen cDNA and 

 several positive recombinant phages were isolated. One recombinant, containing a 17 kb sheep genomic insert, was demonstrated to have coding sequences corresponding to 60% of the 3' end of a2 mRNA. Prior studies showed that the insert in SpC3 was not due to ligation of noncontiguous restriction fragments and/or genetic rearrangement during the cloning process (2). Electron mi croscopy. 

 To visualize the recombinant bacteriophage DNA structure complementary to a2 collagen mRNA, 1 iig of SpC3 DNA was lyophilized with 1 ig or 100 ng of mRNA 

 to give DNA:mRNA ratios of 1:1 and 10:1, respectively. These were then dissolved in 10 i1 of R loop buffer [70% (v/v) deionized formamide, 0.1 N-[tris (hydroxy

 70% formamide method. Immediately before spreading onto a deionized 

 water hypophase, the nucleic acid mixtures were diluted an additional 10-fold in R loop buffer and cytochrome c, 100 vg/ml, was added. 

 Urea-formamide method.   The nucleic acid solutions were spread using a modification of the method of Westphal and Lai (8,9). The hyperphase contained 55% formamide, 2.6 M urea, 0.009 M EDTA, 0.09 M tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and the nucleic acid mixture (approximately 0.1 to 1.0 ig/ml). 

 The mixture was heated at 40? for 30 sec, placed in ice water, and then allowed to reach room temperature. Cytochrome c, 100 pg/ml, was added immediately before spreading onto a deionized water hypophase. 

 The nucleic acid-protein films from both methods were absorbed onto 

 parlodion-coated grids, stained with uranyl acetate (10), dehydrated in 90% ethanol and rotary-shadowed with platinum-palladium (80:20) at an angle of 50. Micrographs were taken with a Siemens Elmiskop 101 electron microscope at an original magnification of 10,000 and an accelerating voltage of 60 kv. Nucleic acid lengths were measured at a final magnification of 43,000 with a 

 Hewlett-Packard 9810A calculator equipped with a 9864A digitizer using pBR322 and fX-174 double and single stranded DNA, respectively, as internal length standards. 

 Approximately 10,000 hybrid molecules were screened for these studies; approximately 200 represented molecules containing unambiguous regions 

 appropriate for quantitative analysis. The mean lengths of each intron and exon were determined for each method and the data expressed as mean ? 

 standard deviation. Nucleic acid lengths of < 50 base pairs could not be 

 accurately determined using the methods outlined above. Thus, in the cases 

 where introns or exons were of this length or less, accurate error estimates could not be made. 

 Bi ohazard precauti ons. 

 The construction and screening of the sheep genomic library together with amplification of pCg45 and preparation of high titre lysates of chimaeric 

 Charon 4A were performed under the physical and biological containment levels specified by the NIH guidelines for recombinant DNA research (11).

 RESULTS 

 Location and orientation of the intervening and a2 mRNA coding sequences in the SpC3 recombinant DNA. 

 Hybridization of fetal sheep tendon type I collagen mRNA to SpC3 DNA 

 yielded a complex R loop pattern in the region where the sheep genomic insert was expected to be ligated to the arms of the lambda vector, Charon 4A. To 

 confirm that these hybridization events were restricted to the inserted sheep DNA fragment, duplex DNA strands on both sides of this hybridization area were measured. Using pBR322 as an internal length standard, the left arm of the phage was found to contain 21,780 ? 1500 bp, and the right arm, 11,950 ? 

 1030 bp, corresponding to the report values for the left and right arms, respectively, of Charon 4A DNA (5,6). 

 The hybridization of SpC3 to a2 mRNA resulted in the destabilization of 

 the inserted helical duplex DNA fragment such that one DNA strand was displaced (Figure 1). Occasionally, the displaced DNA strand was mostly absent, probably due to fragmentation induced by accidental mechanical shearing. This event considerably enhanced the visualization and ordering of the introns. 

 As the a2 mRNA annealed to complementary DNA regions present in one 

 DNA strand, numerous single-stranded loops resulted. These loops, referred to as introns, represented DNA sequences not complementary to the mRNA. Although, by convention, introns are usually sequentially labeled 5' to 3', an opposite order had to be employed in this case as SpC3 does not contain the sequences coding for the 5' end of sheep a2 mRNA. Infrequently, all introns 

 were clearly observed within the same hybrid molecule (Figure 1). The largest introns were towards the left arm of Charon 4A and were more clustered than the introns at the opposite end of the hybrid. Thus, much of the genetic 

 information coding for the a2 mRNA was contained in that half of the hybrid attached to the right arm. 

 A small non-hybridized tail was consistently found in the region where 

 the right arm of the phage was ligated to the sheep genomic insert (Figure 1). This tail likely corresponded to the 3' poly A sequence of the a2 mRNA. At 

 the extreme 5' end of the insert, a variable length was often observed for the remaining unhybridized mRNA strand. This was most likely due to the size heterogeneity of the a2 mRNA used in these studies. 

 Size determination and comparative analysis of SpC3 introns. 

 Although localization of exon and intron sequences was possible with both the 70% formamide and urea-formamide spreading methods, the probability of 

 detecting unambiguous regions in a hybrid molecule was far greater with the

 example, the lowest probability event, the detection of intron 17 and the surrounding small exons, "q" and "r", was only observed by way of the ureaformamide spreading procedure. 

 The smallest introns, 7 and 12, were found to contain approximately 

 the same number of bases. Introns 1 through 8, representing the DNA sequences which split the a2 coding sequence corresponding to the 3' end of the a2 mRNA, varied in length over approximately a 2.4-fold range. With the exception of

 Size determination and the comparative analysis of SpC3 exons. 

 Eighteen exons, "a" through "r", were mapped (Table 2). The largest exon, "a", located on the extreme 3' end of the sheep genomic insert, contained 

 approximately 800 bp. With the exception of exon "m", exons larger than 150 

 base pairs were confined to the genetic region corresponding to the far 3' end of the a2 mRNA. Exon "a" and exon "b", the two exons situated on either side of intron 1, coded for around 1000 bases of a2 collagen information; these two 

 exons contained one-third of the mapped 3,014 DNA bases complementary to a2 mRNA Length distribution and organization of the introns and exons in the sheep genomi c i nsert. 

 There was a sharp contrast in the size distribution of the exons and introns contained within SpC3 (Figure 2). While the intron sizes varied 

 considerably, the exons, in general, showed a very narrow distribution of 

 lengths, and thus tended to cluster at the lowest end of the length distri

 The maps of the a2 collagen gene obtained with both electron micro

 scopic spreading methods were almost identical (Figure 3), except that the 

 region at the extreme 5' end of the insert could only be mapped with the ureaformamide method. From these measurements we concluded that the length of the a2 collagen genetic regi?on in SpC3 was 17,084 bases long with only 3,014 bases actually coding for a2 mRNA. Therefore, only 18% of the mapped 17 kb sheep genetic insert actually contained a2 structural information. 

 DISCUSSION 

 The organizational structure of the a2 collagen gene is complex. A minimum of 17 introns interrupt the 3 kb of ca2 genetic information interspersed as 18 exons over 17 kb of sheep DNA. With the exception of exon "a" located at the extreme 3' end of the inserted a2 gene, all other mapped exons are rather small, exhibiting a size distribution range of 50 to 250 bp. In 

 contrast, the intron sizes range from 340 to 1540 bases occupying a total 

 of 14 kb. Thus, the DNA region containing the 3 kb of a2 collagen genetic information is 5.6 fold longer than the corresponding co2 mRNA sequences. 

 Although the total number of introns present within the 60% 3' portion 

 of the a2 sheep gene was determined to be 17, variation in the precise number

 of introns present in individual hybrid molecules was observed. The reason 

 for this may be due to size heterogeneity of the a2 mRNA used as a complementary probe. Although the a2 mRNA was extensively purified (2), some degradation was likely present. It is also possible that additional introns exist that are too small to be detected by electron microscopic R loop analysis. The most likely a2 genetic regions containing such introns are exons "g" and "m". Small 

 "protrusions" were sometimes observed within these exons that could represent small introns. Very small introns have been reported for tRNA genes (12,13), 

 and it will be necessary to sequence these regions of SpC3 to determine if such introns are present within the a2 sheep genome. 

 The existence of mRNAs comprised of sequences complementary to noncontiguous regions in a DNA genome was first described for adenovirus (14,15) and 

 simian virus (16,17) genes. Similar observations were soon reported for eukaryotic genes, including serum albumin (18), conalbumin (19), fibroin (20), s

 globin (21,22), growth hormones (23,24), immunoglobulin (25), lysozyme (26), 

 ovalbumin (27-29), ovomucoid (30), rRNA (31-34), tRNA (12,13), and vitellogenin (35). The precise number or occurrence of introns within these genes does not seem to follow any clear pattern. However, the genes for albumin, conalbumin, 

 lysozyme, ovalbumin, and ovomucoid exhibit a structural organization comparable to the a2 collagen gene. All of these genes are composed of numerous small 

 exons, usually less than 250 base pairs, and introns which show a large size variation within an individual gene. Within all of these genomes, the DNA 

 regions required for coding structural formation are 4 to 7 times longer than the corresponding mRNA coding sequences. 

 As with the a2 collagen gene, a large unique exon at the extreme 3' end 

 is also present in the ovalbumin gene (36,37). In the a2 gene, this exon was 800 to 900 nucleotides in length, while in the ovalbumin gene the exon contained 1,030 base pairs. Interestingly, this ovalbumin exon contained 634-650 base pairs ot DNA sequence to the 3' side of the terminator 

 triplet, suggesting the ovalbumin mRNA has a large untranslated region at the 3' end. 

 The consistent appearance of a small non-hybridized tail, approximately 100 nucleotides in length, in the region where the right arm of the phage was ligated to the sheep genomic insert of SpC3 very likely corresponded to the 

 3' poly A sequence of the a2 mRNA. This would suggest that the a2 mRNA coding sequence terminates very near or at this point in the genome. Previously published biochemical evidence (2) obtained from restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis using [32P]-labeled chick a2 cDNA probe supports

 this observation. 

 It is unclear what role introns play in genetic expression. However, 

 it is known that these sequences are tranncribed as part of larger precursor mRNAs and the introns are then excised and the fragmented mRNA chains 

 covalently rejoined (38). Some evidence has recently accumulated demonstrating the existence of precursor a2 mRNAs (39,40). However, if the introns in the a2 gene are transcribed in their entirety, as has been 

 demonstrated for the introns in ovalbumin and globin (41,42), much larger precursor a2 mRNAs may exist than those reported to date. For if the re

 mainder of the a2 collagen gene has a structural organization comparable to the 60% 3' portion that has been analyzed, it is probable that the a2 

 collagen gene in its entirety is dispersed throughout a 30 kb DNA segment.
