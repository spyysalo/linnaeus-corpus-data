The synthesis and characterization of four di- and tri-n-butyltin cysteaminates and_ N,N-dimethylcysteaminates and three protonated / quaternized derivatives are reported. They all exhibit moderate or high in vitro cytotoxic activity. Six of seven compounds presented in this work are more active than cisplatin, etoposide and 5-fluorouracil, but less active than methotrexate and doxorubiein. Introduction. 

 Several organotin cysteaminates (aminoethylthiolates) have been studied 1-4 as compounds with potentially high biological activity, but little is known about their cytotoxic effect. The present paper reports the synthesis and characterization of di- and tri-n-butyltin cysteaminates and their N,N-dimethyl analogues and their in vitro cytotoxicity. It is shown that a correct evaluation of the biological activity of organotin compounds remains 5 often hampered by their low water solubility. Therefore, we focused on the synthesis of derivatives with potentially higher water solubility by introducing ionic groups into the molecule by protonation or quatemization of a nitrogen atom.

 Compounds 1- 4, and 7, are poorly soluble in aqueous solutions (< mg/mL). Compounds 5 and 6 exhibit higher water solubilities (ca. 2 mg/mL). Compounds 1 7 are soluble in a therapeutic solution (0,103 M solution of NaCl in water/DMSO 1/9). A white turbidity appears in these solutions only after several hours due to slow hydrolysis. Compounds 1 7 were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The NMR parameters are given in Table 2. Table 2. Resonances of 13C, (ca 20% sol. v/v) 1' compound

 C resonances were assigned on the basis of the values of n J( 119 Sn, 13 C) coupling constants and standard 13 C- APT techniques utilization in agreement with ref.. The values of 119 Sn chemical shifts are found in the interval characteristic for fourcoordinated tin 6,7. The values of the coupling constants j(1 lqSn,13C) agree with the structure proposed. Compound 3 is characterized by a somewhat larger upfield shift, close to the upper limit of the above mentioned interval, together with a high value of 1j(l lqSn,13C) (495 Hz). 67 The C-Sn-C angle, est'mated, from this value of coupling constant is 124 According to ref. this behaviour can be due to intermolecular association increasing the coordinatitn number of tin in concentrated solutions, as suggested by the concentration dependence of tS( Sn) and cryoscopic measurements in benzene. The values of the 6(SN)chemical shifts of compounds 1, 2 and 4 only slightly differ from the (15N) values of the free cysteamine. The significantly larger i(15N) chemical shift of compound 3 is however much lower than those of compounds 5, 6 and 7 containing a N interaction in compounds 1 tetracoordinated nitrogen atom. It can be stated that the Sn 4 is negligible or only very weak in chlorofom solutions. This conclusion is not in contradiction with the proved Sn N interaction found in the solid state 8. 13

 Antitumour activity. 

 The results of the in vitro antitumour tests of compounds 1 7 are given in Table 3 as the inhibition doses IDs0 observed against a panel of seven human tumour cell lines, MCF-7 and EVSA-T, two breast cancers, WiDr, a colon cancer, IGROV, an ovarian cancer, M19 MEL, a melanoma, A248, a renal cancer, and H226, a non-small cell lung cancer. The antitumour tests results are compared with those obtained for clinically used reference compounds9 like cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate. Table 3.

 It is evident from Table 3 that all studied compounds exhibit excellent cytostatic activities, except compound 7 showing only moderate activity. Compounds 1 6 are more active than cisplatin and, in most cases, than etoposide and 5-fluorouracil. Their activity is lower than that of doxorubicin and methotrexate in most cases for the studied cancer cell lines. The very limited set of acquired activity values show that the activity of tri-n-butyltin are higher than those of di-n-butyl analogues (1>3, 2>4) for all cell lines, especially compounds against WiDr. The N,N-dimethyl derivatives exhibit an activity comparable to or somewhat higher than that of unmethylated compounds. Compound 8, with a quaternized nitrogen, exhibits the lowest cytotoxic activities, approximatively 9 times lower than compound 2. It might be underlined that the ionic more water-soluble compounds 5 and 6 are not more active than the uncharged analogs 1-4, whereas the hydrophilic organotin polyoxacarboxylates exhibit much higher in vitro activities than other organotin carxylates 51 Compounds 5 and 6 (with a protonated nitrogen) exhibit activities comparable or even considerably higher (compound 5)against EVSA-T than the corresponding unprotonated compounds. Compound 7 (with a quaternized nitrogen) exhibits the lowest cytostatic activities, approximately 9 times should however be mentioned that another ionic organotin lower than compound 2. It compound, bis(dicyclohexyl)ammonium bis(2,6-pyridinecarboxyla,to)di-n-butylstannate, where the organotin moiety is this time anionic, is also as active as the uncharged analog l. All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 360 instrument using a 5 mm multinuclear tuneable probe. The residual CHCI3 resonance at 7.24 ppm was used as reference for the H soectra and the central 13CDCI3 resonance at 77.0 ppm, for the 13C spectra. The 119 Sn chemical shifts were refered to the external tetramethyltin [6( 119 Sn) 0.0]. The 15N NMR spectra were measur;l using the INEPT technique or in inverse-gated mode. (reference: Instrumentation. 

 external nitromethane, [5('N) 0.0]). The protocol followed for the in vitro antitumour screenings has been already reported 10.
